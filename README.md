Linear scaling transformation, also known as uniform scaling or isotropic scaling, is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer graphics that involves resizing an object or vector uniformly along all axes while preserving its shape and orientation. This transformation is characterized by scaling factors that apply equally in all directions, resulting in a proportional change in size without distortion.
